# Basketball Data Analysis

This is a college project for the course "Applied Statistics for STEM" (MAT-243). The goals of this project are:

1. Apply statistical techniques to address research problems
2. Perform hypothesis testing to address an authentic problem
3. Perform regression analysis to address an authentic problem

### Role:

This project is structures in a real world based scenario where I am a `data analyst` for a basketball team.

## Part 1:

### Scenario:

You are a data analyst for a basketball team. You have found a large set of historical data, and are working to analyze and find patterns in the data set. The coach of the team and your management have requested that you use descriptive statistics and data visualization techniques to study distributions of key variables associated with the performance of different teams. Data-driven analytics will help the management make decisions to further improve your team’s performance. You will use the Python programming language to perform your statistical analysis. You will also need to present a report of your findings to the team’s management. Since the managers are not data analysts, you will need to interpret your findings and describe their practical implications. The managers will use your report to find areas where the team can improve its performance.

## Part 2:

### Scenario:

You are a data analyst for a basketball team. You have found a large set of historical data, and are working to analyze and find patterns in the data set. The coach of the team and your management have requested that you perform several hypothesis tests to find the statistical significance of the claims that are being made about your team. This analysis will provide evidence to validate critical claims and get statistically valid findings that will help make key decisions to make the team better in upcoming seasons. You will use the Python programming language to perform statistical analysis and will also need to present a report of your findings to the team’s management. Since the managers are not data analysts, you will need to interpret your findings and describe their practical implications. The managers will use your report to find areas where the team can improve its performance.

- NOTE: Reference [Part 2](/Part%202/) folder to see code, data and report explaining the findings.

## Part 3:

### Scenario:

You are a data analyst for a basketball team and have access to a large set of historical data that you can use to analyze performance patterns. The coach of the team and your management have requested that you come up with regression models that predict the number of wins in a regular game based on the performance metrics that are included in the data set. These regression models will help make key decisions to improve the performance of the team. You will use the Python programming language to perform the statistical analyses and then prepare a report of your findings to present for the team’s management. Since the managers are not data analysts, you will need to interpret your findings and describe their practical implications.
